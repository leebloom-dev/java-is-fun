JAVA STATIC METHOD
============================

The keyword static allows methods to be independent of
any instance created for the class.

Static is a non-access modifier for methods and attributes.
Static methods/attributes can be accessed without creating an
object.

============================

Why Should We Use Static?
- uses memory resources more efficiently. (Efficient Memory Management)
- not using any instance variable.
- code to be shared by all instance methods
- don't want method to be changed or overridden.
- writing utility classes that shouldn't be changed.
