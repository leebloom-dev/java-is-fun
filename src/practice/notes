NOTES ON INTERFACES
---------------------
1. Similar to abstract classes, interfaces can't be used to
create objects.

2. Interface methods don't have a body of code.

3. Must override all methods when implementing an interface.

4. Interface methods default as abstract and public

5. Interface attributes default as public, static, and final.

6. No constructors

=======================

WHY USE INTERFACES?
1. Security - hide certain details and only show important details
of an object.

2. Java doesn't support "multiple inheritance" except for interfaces.
A class can implement multiple interfaces.
